Hey there! I am a third-year master's student at the School of Software Engineering, **Dalian University of Technology**. I am under the guidance of Prof. [Yu Liu](https://liuyudut.github.io) and Prof. [Qi Jia](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/guqi/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests are predominantly in **Computer Vision** and **Multi-modal Learning**, with a specific emphasis on Continual Learning, Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. I am passionate about exploring these areas to contribute to advancements in the field. I will start my PhD journey from August 2025 in US.
