Hey there! I am a third-year master's student at the School of Software Engineering, Dalian University of Technology. I am under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. [Yu Liu](https://liuyudut.github.io) and Assoc. Prof. [Qi Jia](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/guqi/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests are predominantly in Computer Vision, with a specific emphasis on Continual Learning, Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, Deepfake Detection, and 3D Point Cloud Classification. I am passionate about exploring these areas to contribute to advancements in the field.
